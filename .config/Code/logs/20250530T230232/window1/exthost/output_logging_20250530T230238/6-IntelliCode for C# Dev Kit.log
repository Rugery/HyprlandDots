[WLC] Initializing whole-line completions (independent from starred completion list items)
[WLC] Yielding to GitHub Copilot for gray-text line completions. If you want to switch to IntelliCode for line completions, disable the GitHub Copilot extension and restart VSCode.
Alternatively, you can set {"intellicode-completions-cdk.runAlongsideCopilot": true } to run both providers at the same time, but this is not recommended because the two extensions will often suggest different completions in the same location, and only one can be shown.
